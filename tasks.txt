Notes:
Caution: When a user pairs their device with another device using BLE, the data that's communicated between the two devices is accessible to all apps on the user's device.

For this reason, if your app captures sensitive data, you should implement app-layer security to protect the privacy of that data. Zdroj: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/ble-overview
